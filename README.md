# BIOSCOPE

The Project ‚ÄúBIOSCOPE‚Äù is a web app(pwa) that lets us to know the information related to the movies. This app will be helpful to find the release date of movies, people can search for movies even by voice. Find out recommendations,also see cast and reviews and trailers of all movies and web series and review any movie and tv shows easily.
Also app helps you keep track of your "Favourite list" which the "firestore-db" keeps safe and sound according to users-login.

In this project, we have used the Recycler view to show the list of the movies. As we click on a movie, it directs the user to another activity that contains the poster along with release date and ratings. On the front page, we have a search interface to search for any movie of our liking. It also contains a spinner that contains options like top rated movies, upcoming movies, now playing and popular movies for the users to choose from.

Plus it will recommend you about the movie/series based on your search and you can even sort the movie/series based on "genre"

Moreover it is a PWA which is an awesome technology through which you can install the app in any device such as android/ios/PC so it is platform independent and also you can obviously access the web app through the given linküòÄ‚úå
